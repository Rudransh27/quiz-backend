It checks whether your instance file is valid, accurate, and meaningful.\n\n##### 🧪 What Bushchat Validates\n\n✅ **Schema Validation**  \n🔍 Checks if every concept (like *Revenue*) is defined correctly in the .xsd taxonomy.\n\n🆔 **Context Validation**  \n🔍 Makes sure `contextRef=\"C1\"` exists and includes valid **entity** and **reporting period** information.\n\n💰 **Unit Validation**  \n🔍 Confirms that units like *INR* or *shares* are defined using the `<unit>` tag and are valid.\n\n🔢 **Data Type Validation**  \n🔍 Ensures values (like 123456.78) follow the correct **data format** (e.g., decimals, strings, dates).\n\n➕ **Calculation Validation**  \n🔍 If the taxonomy defines formulas (like *Assets = Liabilities + Equity*), it verifies that the math **adds up correctly**.\n\n📊 **Dimensional Validation**  \n🔍 Validates that any **axis-member combinations** used in facts (e.g., region = Asia) are correct and allowed.\n\n🏷️ **Label & Presentation Check**  \n🔍 Ensures each concept is **properly labeled** and appears in the correct section of the report.\n\n📏 **Xule Rules (Business Logic)**  \n🔍 Applies custom rules like:\n• Revenue > 0\n• Date must be in the current fiscal year\n• Total > Subparts\n\n📂 Bushchat reads both:\n- Your **XBRL Instance Document** (the data),\n- And your **Taxonomy** (the rules).\n\n🧠 Then it validates every part to give you clear ✅ passes or ❌ errors so you can fix issues before filing."

You **must choose** one of the options already provided in the XBRL dictionary (taxonomy).\n\n**Example:**\n- **Dimension Axis:** `ProductCategory`\n- **Allowed Choices (Members):** `MobilePhones`, `Laptops`, `TVs`\n  *You can only pick 'MobilePhones', 'Laptops', or 'TVs'. You can't make up 'Headphones' if it's not on the list!* 🚫\n\n--- \n\n#### 2. 🧾 Typed Dimensions\n\n**When to use:** When your categories can be **any custom value** of a certain type. ✍️\n\n**Think of it like:** A text box ⌨️ or number input field. You provide the value yourself, as long as it fits the expected format (e.g., a number, a date, an address).\n\n**Example:**\n- **Dimension Axis:** `CustomerAge`\n- **Allowed Values:** Any whole number (integer) 🔢\n  *You can enter '25', '30', '42', etc. Any valid number is fine!* 👍\n\n--- \n\n**In Short:**\n- **Explicit:** Pick from a list (e.g., 'Asia', 'Europe', 'North America'). 🌍\n- **Typed:** Write your own value (e.g., '123 Main St.', 'Invoice_9876'). 🏠"

This flexibility allows XBRL-enabled software to show the most appropriate label for any given view. 📊\n\nHere are the most common types of labels:\n\n1.  **Standard Label** (`http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/label`)\n    - This is the **primary or default label**. ✅ It's usually a clear, commonly understood name for the concept.\n    - *Use Case:* General display in a financial statement table.\n\n2.  **Terse Label** (`http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/terseLabel`)\n    - This is a **short, concise label**, often used when space is limited (e.g., in a narrow column or a summary view). 🤏\n    - *Use Case:* Column headers in a compact report, mobile views.\n\n3.  **Verbose Label** (`http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/verboseLabel`)\n    - This is a **longer, more descriptive label** that provides additional context or explanation for the concept. 💬\n    - *Use Case:* Tooltips, detailed disclosures, or explanations in complex reports.\n\n**Example:** Labeling `NetIncomeLoss` with different roles:\n```xml\n<link:labelLink xlink:type=\"extended\" xlink:role=\"http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/labelLinkbase\">\n  <link:loc xlink:href=\"../taxonomy.xsd#ex_NetIncomeLoss\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:label=\"loc_netIncome\"/>\n\n  <link:label xlink:label=\"lab_netIncome_std\" xlink:type=\"resource\" xlink:role=\"http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/label\">Net Income (Loss)</link:label>\n  <link:labelArc xlink:from=\"loc_netIncome\" xlink:to=\"lab_netIncome_std\" xlink:arcrole=\"http://www.xbrl.org/2003/arcrole/concept-label\" xlink:type=\"arc\"/>\n\n  <link:label xlink:label=\"lab_netIncome_trs\" xlink:type=\"resource\" xlink:role=\"http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/terseLabel\">Net Inc.</link:label>\n  <link:labelArc xlink:from=\"loc_netIncome\" xlink:to=\"lab_netIncome_trs\" xlink:arcrole=\"http://www.xbrl.org/2003/arcrole/concept-label\" xlink:type=\"arc\"/>\n\n  <link:label xlink:label=\"lab_netIncome_vrb\" xlink:type=\"resource\" xlink:role=\"http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/verboseLabel\">Net income or loss attributable to the reporting entity</link:label>\n  <link:labelArc xlink:from=\"loc_netIncome\" xlink:to=\"lab_netIncome_vrb\" xlink:arcrole=\"http://www.xbrl.org/2003/arcrole/concept-label\" xlink:type=\"arc\"/>\n</link:labelLink>\n```\n\n**Key Elements in a Label Linkbase (Recap):**\n- `<link:labelLink>`: The main container for label relationships.\n- `<link:loc>`: Locators, which point to the concepts you want to label (e.g., `ex:NetIncomeLoss`).\n- `<link:label>`: Defines the actual text of the label and its `xlink:role`.\n- `<link:labelArc>`: Connects the concept (from `<link:loc>`) to its label (to `<link:label>`)."

              "text": "XML stands for **eXtensible Markup Language**. 📜 It's a markup language, just like HTML, but with a different purpose.\n\nWhile HTML is designed to *display* data (how things look on a webpage), XML is designed to *describe* data. It focuses on what the data *is*.\n\nThink of it this way:\n- **HTML:** 'This is a **bold** paragraph.' (Focus on presentation)\n- **XML:** `<product><name>Laptop</name><price>1200</price></product>` (Focus on data meaning)\n\n**Key Characteristics of XML:**\n1.  **Extensible:** You can define your *own* tags (elements) to describe your data. There are no predefined tags like in HTML.\n2.  **Self-Describing:** The tags themselves often give a clue about the data they contain, making it human-readable.\n3.  **Hierarchical:** Data is organized in a tree-like structure with a root element and nested elements.\n4.  **Platform Independent:** XML data can be easily exchanged between different applications and systems.\n5.  **Strict Rules:** XML is much stricter than HTML about syntax. Every start tag must have an end tag, attributes must be quoted, etc. This makes it easier for machines to parse.\n\n**Why is XML important for XBRL?**\nXBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) is *built entirely on XML*. All XBRL documents – taxonomies, instance documents, and linkbases – are essentially XML files that follow specific XBRL rules and structures. Understanding XML is the first step to understanding XBRL. 🧱"

They represent distinct pieces of information.\n\nAn element typically consists of three parts:\n1.  **Start Tag:** Marks the beginning of an element (e.g., `<book>`).\n2.  **Content:** The data or other elements contained within the element.\n3.  **End Tag:** Marks the end of an element (e.g., `</book>`).\n\n**Structure of an Element:**\n```xml\n<elementName>Content goes here</elementName>\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```xml\n<product>\n  <name>Wireless Headphones</name>\n  <price>99.99</price>\n  <currency>USD</currency>\n</product>\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `<product>` is an element containing other elements.\n- `<name>`, `<price>`, and `<currency>` are elements containing text content.\n\n**Rules for Element Naming:**\n- Names can contain letters, numbers, and other characters.\n- Names cannot start with the letters 'xml' (or XML, Xml, etc.).\n- Names cannot start with a number or punctuation character.\n- Names cannot contain spaces.\n- XML names are case-sensitive (`<Book>` is different from `<book>`).\n\n**Empty Elements:**\nAn element can exist without any content. These are called **empty elements**.\nYou can write them in two ways:\n1.  With a separate start and end tag: `<break></break>`\n2.  Using a self-closing tag: `<break/>`\n\n**Example of an empty element:**\n```xml\n<lineBreak/>\n<image src=\"logo.png\"/>\n```\n\nIn XBRL, concepts like `<xbrli:context>` or `<xbrli:unit>` are XML elements, often containing other nested elements to describe their full meaning. Facts like `<ex:Assets>` are also elements."

              "text": "While elements contain the main data, **attributes** provide *additional information* about an element. They are defined directly within the element's start tag.\n\nThink of attributes as properties or characteristics of an element that further describe it.\n\n**Structure of an Attribute:**\n```xml\n<elementName attributeName=\"attributeValue\">\n  Content\n</elementName>\n```\n\n- **`attributeName`**: The name of the attribute.\n- **`attributeValue`**: The value assigned to the attribute. This *must* be enclosed in single (`'`) or double (`\"`) quotes.\n\n**Example:**\n```xml\n<product category=\"electronics\" id=\"P001\">\n  <name>Smartphone</name>\n  <price>799.00</price>\n</product>\n```\n\nHere, `category` and `id` are attributes of the `<product>` element, providing more context about that specific product.\n\n**When to use Elements vs. Attributes?**\nGenerally:\n- **Elements** are best for data that is part of the document's structure or content (e.g., `<name>`, `<price>`).\n- **Attributes** are best for data that describes the data in an element or provides metadata (e.g., `id`, `type`, `status`).\n\n**XBRL and Attributes:**\nAttributes are *extensively* used in XBRL to provide crucial metadata for elements. For example:\n- In a Label Linkbase: `xlink:type=\"resource\"`, `xlink:role=\"http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/label\"`\n- In an Instance Document: `contextRef=\"C2023_YE\"`, `unitRef=\"USD\"`, `decimals=\"-3\"`\n\nThese attributes provide essential context and define how XBRL processors should interpret the elements they belong to. Without them, the XBRL data would be just plain numbers and text, lacking critical meaning. 💡"

              "text": "Every well-formed XML document must follow a specific structural rule: it must have exactly one **root element**.\n\nThe **root element** is the top-level element that contains all other elements in the document. It's like the trunk of a tree, from which all other branches (child elements) sprout. 🌳\n\n**Example of a simple XML structure:**\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<catalog>  \n  <book id=\"bk101\">\n    <author>J.K. Rowling</author>\n    <title>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</title>\n    <price>19.99</price>\n  </book>\n  <book id=\"bk102\">\n    <author>George Orwell</author>\n    <title>1984</title>\n    <price>12.50</price>\n  </book>\n</catalog>\n```\n\nIn this example, `<catalog>` is the root element. It contains two `<book>` elements, which in turn contain `<author>`, `<title>`, and `<price>` elements.\n\n**Hierarchy (Parent-Child Relationships):**\n- An element that contains another element is called the **parent**.\n- An element contained within another element is called a **child**.\n- Elements at the same level, sharing the same parent, are called **siblings**.\n\nFrom the example above:\n- `<catalog>` is the parent of the `<book>` elements.\n- The `<book>` elements are children of `<catalog>`.\n- `<author>`, `<title>`, and `<price>` are children of `<book>`.\n- The two `<book>` elements are siblings.\n\n**XBRL and Root Elements:**\n- **XBRL Instance Document:** The root element is always `<xbrl:xbrl>`.\n- **XBRL Taxonomy Schema:** The root element is typically `<xs:schema>`.\n- **XBRL Linkbases (Label, Presentation, etc.):** These also have their own specific root elements, like `<link:labelLink>`.\n\nThis structured, hierarchical nature is what makes XML (and thus XBRL) so powerful for organizing complex data in a consistent and machine-readable way. 🏗️"

It always starts with `<?xml` and ends with `?>`.\n\n2.  **`version=\"1.0\"`**: This attribute specifies the XML version being used. Currently, `1.0` is the most common and widely supported version.\n\n3.  **`encoding=\"UTF-8\"`**: This attribute specifies the character encoding for the XML document. It tells the XML parser how to interpret the bytes of the document into characters.\n    - **`UTF-8`**: This is the most common and recommended encoding. It supports virtually all characters from all languages, making it highly versatile.\n    - Other common encodings include `ISO-8859-1` (for Western European languages) or `UTF-16`.\n\n4.  **`standalone=\"yes|no\"` (Optional):** This attribute indicates whether the XML document is standalone, meaning it doesn't rely on an external Document Type Definition (DTD) for its validity.\n    - `yes`: The document is standalone (does not require external DTDs).\n    - `no`: The document is not standalone (requires external DTDs).\n    - If omitted, the default is `no` if there's an external DTD, and `yes` otherwise.\n\n**Example in an XBRL Context:**\nYou will see this at the very top of every XBRL schema, instance document, and linkbase file:\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<xbrl xmlns=\"http://www.xbrl.org/2003/instance\" ...>\n  \n</xbrl>\n```\n\nThe XML declaration ensures that XML parsers (the software that reads and understands XML) correctly interpret the document's characters and version, preventing errors and ensuring proper processing. It's the essential kickoff to any XML file. 🚀"

              "text": "Imagine you're building a report that includes financial data and product data. Both might have an element named `<date>`. How does an XML parser know if `<date>` means 'reporting date' or 'manufacture date'? This is where **XML Namespaces** come in. 🚧\n\n**What are XML Namespaces?**\nNamespaces provide a way to avoid element and attribute name conflicts by providing a mechanism to uniquely qualify element and attribute names. They effectively create 'families' or 'vocabularies' of XML elements.\n\n**Why do we need Namespaces?**\nIn complex XML documents (like XBRL, which combines multiple standards):\n1.  **Ambiguity:** Prevents confusion when different XML vocabularies (sets of elements) use the same element name for different purposes.\n2.  **Modularity:** Allows for mixing and matching elements from different schemas without name clashes.\n3.  **Uniqueness:** Ensures that an element name is unique within its context.\n\n**How Namespaces Work:**\nNamespaces are identified by a **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**. This URI is typically a URL (e.g., `http://www.xbrl.org/2003/instance`), but it doesn't have to point to an actual webpage. Its primary purpose is to serve as a unique identifier for the namespace.\n\nTo use a namespace, you declare it using the `xmlns` attribute (XML Namespace) within an element's tag. This declaration applies to the element it's declared on and all its descendants.\n\n**Example Scenario (without namespaces):**\n```xml\n<report>\n  <date>2023-12-31</date> \n  <item>\n    <date>2023-11-15</date> \n  </item>\n</report>\n```\nHere, `date` is ambiguous.\n\n**Example Scenario (with namespaces):**\n```xml\n<report \n  xmlns:fin=\"http://example.com/financial\"\n  xmlns:prod=\"http://example.com/product\">\n  \n  <fin:date>2023-12-31</fin:date>\n  <prod:item>\n    <prod:date>2023-11-15</prod:date>\n  </prod:item>\n</report>\n```\nNow, `fin:date` clearly refers to a financial date, and `prod:date` refers to a product date. The ambiguity is resolved! ✅\n\nIn XBRL, you'll see namespaces like `xbrli`, `link`, and custom prefixes for taxonomy-specific concepts. This is how XBRL manages its complex structure and integrates definitions from various sources."

              "text": "When you see a colon (`:`) in an XML tag or attribute, like `xbrli:context` or `link:labelArc`, it signifies the use of an **XML Namespace Prefix**.\n\n**What is a Prefix?**\nA prefix is a short, readable alias (nickname) that you associate with a longer, unique namespace URI. Instead of writing the full URI every time you use an element from that namespace, you use the shorter prefix.\n\n**How are Prefixes Declared?**\nPrefixes are declared using the `xmlns:` attribute, followed by the chosen prefix, and then the equal sign and the namespace URI in quotes.\n\n**Structure:** `xmlns:yourPrefix=\"http://the/unique/namespace/uri\"`\n\n**Example:**\n```xml\n<xbrl \n  xmlns:xbrli=\"http://www.xbrl.org/2003/instance\" \n  xmlns:link=\"http://www.xbrl.org/2003/linkbase\" \n  xmlns:ex=\"http://www.example.com/mycompany/taxonomy\">\n  \n  <xbrli:context id=\"c1\">...</xbrli:context>\n  <link:labelLink>...</link:labelLink>\n  <ex:Assets>...</ex:Assets>\n  \n</xbrl>\n```\nIn this example:\n- `xmlns:xbrli=\"http://www.xbrl.org/2003/instance\"` declares that `xbrli` is the prefix for the XBRL instance namespace.\n- `xmlns:link=\"http://www.xbrl.org/2003/linkbase\"` declares `link` for the XBRL linkbase namespace.\n- `xmlns:ex=\"http://www.example.com/mycompany/taxonomy\"` declares `ex` for a custom taxonomy namespace.\n\n**The Role of the Colon (`:`):**\nThe colon separates the **prefix** from the **local name** of the element or attribute.\n\n**Example:** `xbrli:context`\n- `xbrli`: This is the prefix, referring to the `http://www.xbrl.org/2003/instance` namespace.\n- `context`: This is the local name of the element.\n- Together, `xbrli:context` uniquely identifies the 'context' element *within the XBRL instance namespace*.\n\n**Default Namespace (`xmlns` without a prefix):**\nYou can also declare a **default namespace** for an element and its children. This means elements within that scope that *don't* have a prefix belong to that default namespace.\n\n**Example:**\n```xml\n<bookstore xmlns=\"http://www.books.com/namespace\">\n  <book>\n    <title>The XML Guide</title>\n  </book>\n</bookstore>\n```\nHere, `bookstore`, `book`, and `title` all belong to the `http://www.books.com/namespace` because it's the default.\n\nIn XBRL, `xbrli` is often declared as the default namespace on the root `<xbrl>` element, so you might sometimes see `<context>` instead of `<xbrli:context>`, depending on how the document is structured. However, using prefixes explicitly is generally clearer, especially when mixing multiple namespaces. 🎯"

This is where **XML Schema Definition (XSD)** comes in. 📐\n\nAn **XML Schema** is an XML-based language used to define the structure, content, and data types of XML documents. It's like a blueprint or a contract that specifies what elements and attributes are allowed, their order, their data types, and their relationships.\n\n**Why is XSD important?**\n1. **Validation:** An XSD can be used to validate an XML document, ensuring it conforms to the defined rules. If a document doesn't follow the schema, it's considered 'invalid.'\n2. **Data Consistency:** Enforces consistent data structures across different XML files.\n3. **Data Types:** Allows for defining specific data types (e.g., integer, date, string, monetary) for elements and attributes, enabling better data processing and validation.\n4. **Tool Support:** Many development tools and parsers can use XSDs to provide auto-completion, validation, and data binding.\n\n**Key Elements in an XSD:**\n- `<xs:schema>`: The root element of every XML Schema document.\n- `<xs:element>`: Defines an XML element. You specify its name, type, and other properties.\n- `<xs:attribute>`: Defines an XML attribute.\n- `<xs:complexType>`: Defines elements that can contain other elements and/or attributes.\n- `<xs:simpleType>`: Defines elements or attributes that can only contain text content, but with specific constraints (e.g., a specific pattern, enumeration of allowed values).\n- `targetNamespace`: Specifies the namespace that elements and attributes declared in *this* schema belong to.\n- `xmlns:xs`: Declares the prefix for the XML Schema namespace (`http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema`).\n\n**Example (Simplified XSD Snippet):**\n```xml\n<xs:schema \n  xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\"\n  targetNamespace=\"http://www.example.com/products\"\n  elementFormDefault=\"qualified\">\n\n  <xs:element name=\"product\">\n    <xs:complexType>\n      <xs:sequence>\n        <xs:element name=\"name\" type=\"xs:string\"/>\n        <xs:element name=\"price\" type=\"xs:decimal\"/>\n        <xs:element name=\"availability\" type=\"xs:boolean\" minOccurs=\"0\"/>\n      </xs:sequence>\n      <xs:attribute name=\"id\" type=\"xs:ID\" use=\"required\"/>\n    </xs:complexType>\n  </xs:element>\n\n</xs:schema>\n```\nThis schema defines that a `<product>` element must have a `name` (string), a `price` (decimal), an optional `availability` (boolean), and a required `id` attribute.\n\n**XSD in XBRL:**\nXBRL Taxonomies are fundamentally defined using XML Schema (`.xsd`) files. These schema files define all the financial and business concepts (like 'Assets', 'Revenue', 'NetIncomeLoss') that can be reported. The data types (monetary, date, text) for these concepts are also defined within the schema. This ensures that XBRL reports use consistent definitions and types, making them reliable and comparable. It's the backbone of XBRL's structure. 🏗️"

This is done using the `xsi:schemaLocation` attribute. 🤝\n\n**What is `xsi:schemaLocation`?**\nThe `xsi:schemaLocation` attribute is part of the XML Schema instance namespace (`http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance`). It provides a hint to an XML parser about where to find the XML Schema file that defines the elements and attributes used in the XML document.\n\n**Structure:**\n```xml\n<rootElement \n  xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n  xsi:schemaLocation=\"namespaceURI locationOfSchemaFile\">\n</rootElement>\n```\nIt takes a list of pairs of values:\n- **namespaceURI**: The target namespace of the schema you want to associate.\n- **locationOfSchemaFile**: The hint (URL or relative path) to the actual `.xsd` file where that namespace is defined.\n\n**Example:**\n```xml\n<catalog \n  xmlns=\"http://www.example.com/products\" \n  xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n  xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.example.com/products products.xsd\">\n  <product id=\"P001\">\n    <name>Laptop</name>\n    <price>1200.00</price>\n  </product>\n</catalog>\n```\nIn this example:\n- `xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"` declares the `xsi` prefix for the XML Schema instance namespace.\n- `xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.example.com/products products.xsd\"` tells the parser: 'For elements in the `http://www.example.com/products` namespace, find their definitions in `products.xsd`.'\n\n**XBRL and `xsi:schemaLocation`:**\nThis attribute is crucial in XBRL Instance Documents to link the instance to the specific taxonomy schema(s) defining the concepts used.\n```xml\n<xbrl \n  xmlns:ex=\"http://www.example.com/mycompany/taxonomy\"\n  xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" \n  xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.example.com/mycompany/taxonomy ../taxonomy.xsd\">\n  <ex:Assets contextRef=\"C1\" unitRef=\"U1\">1000000</ex:Assets>\n</xbrl>\n```\nHere, the instance document declares that concepts from the `http://www.example.com/mycompany/taxonomy` namespace are defined in the `../taxonomy.xsd` file. This allows XBRL processors to load the correct taxonomy and validate the instance."

XBRL stands for **eXtensible Business Reporting Language**.\n\nAt its heart, XBRL takes the flexibility of XML and applies it to financial and business data, adding semantic meaning and validation. 📊\n\n**The Big Picture of XBRL:**\nXBRL creates a standardized, machine-readable format for business reports through two main types of documents:\n\n### 1. XBRL Taxonomies (The Dictionary/Blueprint)\nA **Taxonomy** is a set of XML Schema (`.xsd`) and Linkbase (`.xml`) files that define reporting concepts and their relationships for a specific reporting domain (e.g., IFRS, US GAAP).\n- **XML Schema (`.xsd`)**: Defines the concepts (like 'Assets', 'Revenue') and their data types.\n- **Linkbases (`.xml`)**: Define relationships between concepts:\n  - **Label Linkbase**: Connects technical concepts to human-readable names.\n  - **Presentation Linkbase**: Defines how concepts are grouped/displayed hierarchically.\n  - **Calculation Linkbase**: Specifies math relationships (e.g., Assets = Liabilities + Equity).\n  - **Definition Linkbase**: Defines other semantic relationships.\n  - **Reference Linkbase**: Links concepts to authoritative accounting literature.\n\n### 2. XBRL Instance Documents (The Actual Report Data)\nAn **Instance Document** is an XML file containing the actual facts reported by an entity for a specific period, using the taxonomy concepts.\n\n**Key XML Elements in Instance Documents:**\n- `<xbrli:context>`: Defines the context (entity, period, dimensions).\n- `<xbrli:unit>`: Defines the unit of measure.\n- Fact elements (e.g., `<ex:Assets>`): Actual reported values, linked to concepts from the taxonomy, with attributes like `contextRef` and `unitRef`.\n\n**How it fits together:**\n1. Taxonomy is created (XSD for concepts, Linkbases for relationships).\n2. Instance Document references taxonomy using `xsi:schemaLocation`.\n3. Data facts are entered, tagged with concepts, and associated with context/unit.\n4. XBRL software validates, analyzes, and renders the data.\n\nThis XML-based structure makes XBRL reports standardized, comparable, and automation-friendly, transforming static reports into dynamic datasets. 🚀"
